# Animations
It works but its scuffed, Probably wont finish it.
Nobody is allowed to download this and use on their personal servers.
This Plugin is only to demonstrate my abilities.
even though its rather scuffed.

Heres a guide on how to use it
First you need to have OP
or the permission "pottercraft.builder"

Then you do this:
1. /animation create <name>

2. Proceed to make a selection with a golden axe. Right click to make selection 1 and Left click to make selection 2

3. /animation addframe <name>

// You dont have to keep the builds you built you dont even have to redo the selection you can change the frame you just created
// to make the frames after it.

4. After you made yourself some frames you'll have to make a playout location. To do so you walk to where you want the animation
played out and you type /animation setplaylocation <name>

// Now to customize the animation. This part is pretty scuffed right now and I'll probably fix it later on.
5. /animation edit <name>
Proceed to click on the different triggers to get the prefered settings for the animation

Now you have an animation set up so you can finally run it with
6. /animation run <name>
